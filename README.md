# tsx-base
Base template for TypeScript, React, ReactRouter and CSS Next.
This is a starting point for web pages that depend on React and TypeScript.
I love using these for my projects, but getting set up is always a pain.
This aims to alleviate the set up process so I can get up and running faster.

## Commands
`./node_modules/.bin/jest --coverage` run all tests with coverage table in CLI
`./node_modules/.bin/webpack` Run webpack

## todos
- Add React Router
- Add Component, Container, Type structure
- Add CSS Next and CSS structure
