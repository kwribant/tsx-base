# tsx-base
- Base template for TypeScript, React, ReactRouter and PostCSS.
- This is a starting point for web pages that depend on React and TypeScript.
- I love using these for my projects, but getting set up is always a pain.
- This aims to alleviate the set up process so I can get up and running faster.  

## Commands
- `npm run test`: run all tests with coverage table in CLI
- `npm run build`: Run webpack

## Structure
- `/src/index.tsx`: Lowest level wrapper for tsx
- `/src/components`: React-based components live here
- `/src/constants`: CSS variables live here
- `/src/pages`: React-based pages live here
- `/src/types`: Global TypeScript types live here

## Todos
[] Add React Router
